        Is it interesting that Dalits see Manu differently than do caste-Hindus? Or, differently than most
        foreigners, learning of Indian culture from a distance? I think so. Looking at Savi Savarkar’s
        image of Manu brings these differences before us. It is largely for these differences that
        Savarkar’s art is created. It is these differences that make his art so important, for Indians and

        for Americans too. For, despite the uniqueness of his vision —which is as idiosyncratically-
        personal as any modernist gallery artist’s must be— Savarkar’s art is most remarkable for the

        expression of his social situation in South Asian culture as a Dalit, and for the immediacy, depth
        and power with which he expresses the meaning of that situation to us.

      <p>
        In India Dalits —the people usually known in the United States by their Brahmanical caste title
        as “untouchables”— make up seventeen per cent of the population and occupy a social and
        economic place at the bottom of the famous caste system, comparable to the situation of African
        Americans in the United States. Savi Savarkar is the rare case of a gallery artist with a national
        and international reputation built upon the role of being a Dalit artist, and a critique of the caste
        system. Viewing his art, even in the United States, brings up difficult and painful questions of
        intercultural and international communication and understanding. While Savarkar’s art reveals
        the sophistication and strength of contemporary India’s elite gallery culture, it also dwells at
        length in polemic confrontation with one of the greatest problems of contemporary Indian
        society.

        Considering Savarkar's art when looking from the United States brings us great opportunities,
        but serious problems as well. The opportunities include learning something about the meaning
        of visual imagery and some things about contemporary culture in South Asia, as well as getting
        to know the work of one finely-tuned artist. The problems include the difficulty for Americans
        of looking from their culture at another, quite unfamiliar one, while for Indians they bring up the
        difficulty of having one’s ancestral culture looked at by foreigners, who may not be altogether
        sympathetic. For all of us there is the challenge of looking not only through sensitive eyes at
        unfamiliar objects, but of looking with nuanced minds, that allow for parsing the differences
        between the negative and positive aspects of a culture without imprinting it in our attitudes as

        essentially one or the other. However sophisticated we may be in accounting for the multi-
        valency of our own actions or our own societies, it is quite a good deal more difficult to account

        for combination of better and worse aspects of others’ cultures. This is particularly true, when
        we know relatively little else about the other society to begin with.

        As an American interpreter of South Asia’s visual imagery and culture, I have spent most of my
        professional career sharing enjoyable, and usually enthusiastic, views of its traditional elite arts.
        Hindu temples and Mughal miniatures are visually rich and immediately enjoyable to most
        audiences and I have had little difficulty communicating either than enjoyment or the traditional
        meanings of this imagery to students and popular audiences around the world. All of us likely
        know the Taj Mahal and most of us have seen pictures of the suavely refined images of Indian
        gods and goddesses, or the Buddha. It takes little effort to explain such works as art or
        architecture, and through them to explain aspects of the culture they come from, while the viewer
        basks in their visual splendor. India’s contemporary gallery art is as satisfying as anything from
        its ancient past. The Savarkar prints and paintings in this exhibition “An Untouchable Reaches
        Out” will fit easily into the formal categories, such as “Expressionism”, that most contemporary
        gallery goers in the United States bring with them. It is the content, their meaning, that demands
        a stretching of our understanding. Though it is a stretch that well repays us for the effort.

        Though it might come as a surprise to those who know little of India, outside of the occasional
        view of the Taj on Television or the annual article on South Asian poverty in the New York
        Times, the gallery art of India’s big cities is quite equivalent to what one finds in every big city
        throughout the modern bourgeois world. Realist portraits and tourist landscapes vie for attention
        with abstractions and the occasional installation or performance piece. If one were to wake up in
        New Delhi’s Triveni or Mumbai’s Jehangir Art Gallery they could hardly tell that they weren’t
        in London or Chicago. So to talk of Savarkar's art is to talk of works in a modernist artworld
        little different than our own, whoever we are. Artist in India mostly sign their works in the same
        Latin script used by artists in Buenos Aires, Iowa City and Paris. Even those artists in India who
        read their morning newspaper in Hindi or Bengali are likely to subscribe to the Art News or Art
        in America. They are as much a part of the burgeoning global culture as cell phone buyers and
        internet users. It is their social world that is distinctly, though not entirely, different. But then
        Savarkar's art is as deeply social as it is personal, and that is where his major importance lies.
        Savarkar is the rare case of a full time political artist and the even rarer case of an identified Dalit
        artist. There are other Dalit artists, but none whose identity is so prominently a part of their
        work.

      </p>

      <p>
        Savarkar’s work is peculiarly personal at the same time as it is political. This also sets him off
        from most contemporary artists, whose work is meant to deal with political themes. Though we
        like to feature politically and socially redolent imagery in our history courses, for their
        connections with the zeitgeist of the cultural moments they express, there are relatively few such
        works produced in the fine arts. “No,” you might object, quickly. “What about Guernica?
        What about Goya’s Disasters of War?” Well, what can we mention next? How much else do we
        have besides these two great works in the modern canon? Very little, I venture. That is one of
        the reasons these two stick out so prominently in our minds. Modern art has tended to shy away
        from social statement with great consistency. Until quite recently, most modern visual artists
        have looked at politically or socially engaged imagery as akin to propaganda. And so may
        Savarkar, though he really doesn’t seem to care. He is so committed to telling his story, he has
        taken little effort to worry about how we will categorize it.

      </p>

      <p>
        The art market is not built upon artists who offer us things we wont enjoy in the bedroom, living
        room or hall. Imagery with political content is almost immediately branded “obvious” or
        “simplistic.” Or, at least the artists who decorate our walls usually feel it will be, if they do
        express themselves politically. A pop singer may indulge once in a while, but seldom a visual
        artist, whose work costs a good deal more, and which we will have to live with day in and day
        out. This is as true of artworld in Delhi and Bangalore as it is in New York and Amherst. In the
        case of Savarkar, this is a particular problem, since the main thrust of his work is to condemn the
        traditional values of the elite castes and classes, who are the only ones in a position to patronize
        gallery art!
        The universal problem of how to interpret visual imagery that is clarified by looking cross
        culturally is found in Savarkar’s use of the familiar swastika sign. As it turns out, once we begin
        to look with care, what is familiar to Americans and what is familiar to Indians is not exactly the
        same thing. To understand its Indian meaning we have to know about India’s traditional culture.
        To understand the modern European and American meaning we need to know modern European
        and American culture. And to understand Savarkar’s use of the swastika, we need to know both
        of these and something about Savarkar himself. In culture what is obvious is not always true and
        what is true is not always as accessible as it may seem. We all know what most of the pictures
        we look at mean, at least most of the time, or at least we think we do. And indeed our ability to
        get through the visual complexity and richness of the everyday world seems to indicate that we
        usually do. Looking between cultures is one way to recognize how convenient that view is and
        how limited.

        <h2>Savarkar’s Dalit Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Viewing Savarkar’s Manu tells us something about both Savarkar and Manu, and something
          about meaning in the visual arts we often forget. That is, that subjects don’t have implicit
          meanings in themselves, but that their meaning is located in the context of their use: the
          perspectives of their producers and consumers, and the situation of their particular usage. One of
          the benefits of looking at works from an unfamiliar culture is that the abstraction of the
          experience allows us to think theoretically about things that are so overwhelmed by intuitive
          meaning in our own culture that we can’t separate our from our feelings about them. Thus where
          it might be difficult for Americans to think abstractly about an image of George Washington or
          the American flag, it is easier for them to be objective about Manu or another Indian symbol.
        </p>
        <p>
          While elites showcase beauty, this art dares to showcase truth. It’s uncomfortable. It’s necessary. And it’s
          growing stronger in both gallery and grassroots spaces.

      <h2>The Artist as Historian</h2>
      <p>
        The oppressed are often erased from official records. Art becomes their archive. A mural in a remote village may
        carry more truth than a thousand official documents. It speaks of struggle, dignity, and survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, young artists mix tradition with tech. Through reels, digital illustrations, and online collectives,
        resistance travels faster than ever. And with every new viewer, the movement grows.
